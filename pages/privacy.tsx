        The length of time that a cookie remains on your computer or mobile device depends on
        whether it is a “persistent” or “session” cookie. Session cookies last until you stop
        browsing and persistent cookies last until they expire or are deleted. Most of the cookies
        we use are persistent and will expire between 30 minutes and two years from the date they
        are downloaded to your device.

When having a website, you are faced with the importance of User Experience(UX). We have
simplified what we think are the top 3 points to consider when planning, designing and
developing your site.

## Speed
Research shows that websites that take more than 3 seconds to load lose more than 40% of
their visitors. In this day and age, people are used to highly performant user experiences and have very high standards when it comes to waiting for a page to load.

## Navigation
Speed is not the only factor. Let’s assume your website loads very fast, but the user
gets frustrated because they can’t seem to figure out how to navigate it, where the menus
are and how to find the content/product they need. The visitor will surely leave your site
and find another one that is easier to navigate.

## Readability
Now that your visitor has found what they are looking for, they are faced with problems of
readability. Content that is difficult to understand and packed with keywords or phrases
that doesn't truly convey the main point of your product or service will hinder the
visitor to stay longer. Content should be clear and understandable.

Google has stressed the importance of user experience (UX) on more than one occasion, the
ranking algorithm gives preference to websites that are fast, readable, and easy to navigate

Here’s a simple checklist you can use to see how good the User Experience on a site is:
-	Fast loading speed
-	Ease of navigation
-	Visually pleasing design
-	Layout doesn't take away from the content.
-	Minimum of pop-ups and annoying ads.

Better user experience prolongs the time a user spends engaging the website. Not only on
desktop but on mobile as well. Research shows staggering growth in mobile searches and
website browsing. Taking the time to invest in good UX will lay the foundation for more
visitors and loyal customers.
